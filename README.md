# Investigating chemical composition similarities in wine samples with unsupervised learning
Using chemical composition data and subjective 'quality' designations of Vinho Verde wine samples, I investigate the following questions:
1. Can the unsupervised learning algorithms K-means, Agglomerative clustering, and Non-zero Matrix Factorization (NMF) produce sample groups matching the subjective quality measures of samples?
2. What is the maximum attainable accuracy of each algorithm, for a given set of optimized hyperparameters  
3. If no algorithm is capable of moderate or greater accuracy, what could be some possible reasons for that?
